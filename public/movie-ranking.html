<h1>The best movies according to Hansraj</h1>
    <h2>My top three movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>1. The Silent Voice</h3>
<p>
I loved this movie because it presented a kid who suffered
mentally from his mistake of hurting someone innocent and made
up the courage to apologize to that person.
</p>

<h3>2. The pianist</h3>
<p>
Shows the struggle of a person who survived the holocaust.
It's a very realistic depiction of what was happening during
the holocaust.
</p>

<h3>3. The Maleficent</h3>
<p>
It's good.
